        <p>Instructions</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dry roast the mixed nuts and seeds for 2-3 minutes in a pan over medium heat. Remove them from the pan and let them cool completely.</li>
          <li>Blend the cooled nuts and seeds first in a blender until they are a coarse, crumbly mixture, then transfer them to a bowl.</li>
          <li>Blend the chopped dates until they form a coarse, sticky paste. Add the date paste in a large bowl and mash it with a spatula for a few minutes.</li>
          <li>Add nuts and seeds mixture to the date mixture in the bowl. Mix everything thoroughly until well combined.</li>
          <li>Once the mixture is cool enough to handle but still warm, lightly grease your palms with a little butter. Take small portions of the mixture and roll them into compact, round balls.</li>
